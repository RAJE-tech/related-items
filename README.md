# Raje Tech Related Items & Comparisons
> Using the [Greenfield API](https://gist.github.com/teddim/e9b76cd5b4fb617afeb6dfb65796d416#file-products_api-md), this microservice will display two sets of related products. The first set will be a list of products, determined internally, that are related to the product currently being viewed. The second set will be a list, custom created by the user, of products which the user has grouped with the current product into an ‘outfit’.
